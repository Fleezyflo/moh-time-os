This idea has award potential, and I don’t want us to lose quality because of delays on their side.

One thing I’m gonna check is if we can focus this on the 3 Saturdays specifically, or if the chances to win are spread evenly over the week. In that case we just need to word it differently, but can still focus on the Saturdays for our comms.\n\nSpecifically on the creatives:\nPhase 1: maybe we can make the whole bag golden for extra effect?\nPhase 2: would be nice if the hands could hold the actual golden burger - I can get 3d render or a real burger over to you.\nPhase 3; shall we say here ’Golden hour. All night long.\nPhase 5: let’s say ‘golden item’ instead of ‘golden bag’.\n\nAlso curious to see how creators would activate this - are we able to review a bit of script/idea soon?",
