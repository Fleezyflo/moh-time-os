# Brief 11: INTELLIGENCE_EXPANSION
> **Objective:** Build the intelligence modules that transform raw data into actionable insight — cost-to-serve analysis, cross-domain pattern recognition, scenario modeling, trajectory prediction, V4/V5 consolidation, and resolution queue automation.
>
> **Why now:** After Brief 9 fills the DB with comprehensive data and Brief 10 proves the autonomous loop is stable, the system has a solid foundation. This brief builds the intelligence layer that makes MOH Time OS a decision engine, not just a data warehouse.

## Scope

### What This Brief Does
1. **Cost-to-serve module** — compute what each client actually costs (hours × rate + overhead), a core MASTER_SPEC DIRECTIVE
2. **Cross-domain pattern recognition** — detect patterns across Asana/Gmail/Calendar/Xero (not just within single data sources)
3. **Scenario modeling** — "If we take this client, what happens to capacity?" predictive analysis
4. **Trajectory & trend wiring** — connect existing signal infrastructure to compute real trajectories
5. **V4/V5 consolidation** — unify the two parallel architectures into one coherent model
6. **Resolution queue automation** — move from framework-only to actual automated resolution execution

### What This Brief Does NOT Do
- Collect more data (Brief 9)
- Harden the loop (Brief 10)
- Build UI (Brief 12)

## Dependencies
- Brief 10 (AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS) complete — stable loop, change tracking, observability

## Task Queue

| Seq | Task ID | Title | Status |
|-----|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | IE-1.1 | Cost-to-Serve Module | PENDING |
| 2 | IE-2.1 | Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition | PENDING |
| 3 | IE-3.1 | Scenario Modeling Engine | PENDING |
| 4 | IE-4.1 | Trajectory & Trend Computation | PENDING |
| 5 | IE-5.1 | V4/V5 Architecture Consolidation | PENDING |
| 6 | IE-6.1 | Resolution Queue Automation | PENDING |
| 7 | IE-7.1 | Intelligence Integration Validation | PENDING |

## Success Criteria
- Cost-to-serve computed for every active client with ≥90% data coverage
- Pattern recognition identifies cross-domain signals (e.g., calendar overload + email spike + task delays = capacity crisis)
- Scenario modeling returns impact projections for client add/remove
- Trajectories computed with real data, not hardcoded trends
- Single unified signal/issue model replaces V4+V5 parallel tables
- Resolution queue executes at least 3 automation types (escalation, reassignment, notification)
