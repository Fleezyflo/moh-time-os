# Step 10 — BUILD CLIENTS (Portfolio + Detail)

## Objective
Build Clients portfolio and client detail reports with drill-down and proof.

## Deliverables
- /clients portfolio (spatial cards, posture summaries)
- /clients/:clientId detail:
  - Open Issues (tagged)
  - Top Proposals (untagged, gate-aware)
  - Evidence tabs (financial/delivery/comms/team) with drill-down only

## Acceptance checks
- Every section maps to query + contract fields.
- Evidence opens anchored excerpts in drawer.
- No primary raw-table page.

## Stop condition
Any unmapped section → STOP and fix.
