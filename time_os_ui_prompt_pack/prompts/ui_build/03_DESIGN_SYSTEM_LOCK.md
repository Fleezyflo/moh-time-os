# Step 3 — DESIGN SYSTEM LOCK (No Code)

## Objective
Lock the design language, confidence UI, and proof-first rendering rules.

## Inputs (read)
- CONTROL_ROOM_QUERIES.md
- PROPOSAL_ISSUE_ROOM_CONTRACT.md
- 06_PROPOSALS_BRIEFINGS.md (eligibility gates)

## Deliverables
Write:
- docs/ui_spec/01_PRODUCT_PRINCIPLES.md
- docs/ui_spec/03_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

Must include:
- 90-second executive session model
- Proposal is the unit of attention
- Proof-first cards (signals + excerpts)
- Confidence UI: linkage vs interpretation
- Minimal status colors (used only for signal/health/confidence)
- Ineligible proposal states + Fix Data CTA language

## Acceptance checks
- Design system defines typography scale + spacing scale + layout grid.
- Confidence tokens are explicit and reusable.
- Eligibility gates are enforced as UI behavior (not prose).

## Stop condition
If confidence/proof gating is not explicitly defined, STOP and fix.
