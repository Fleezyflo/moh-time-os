# Step 15 — TESTS + SCREENSHOTS + DONE REPORT

## Objective
Make it shippable: tests, deterministic sorting, and visual evidence.

## Deliverables
1) Tests:
- page snapshot tests for main routes
- deterministic sorting tests
- “no eligible proposal without proof” tests
- drawer + evidence anchor tests

2) Visual evidence:
- export screenshots from running UI to docs/ui_spec/visuals_run/

3) Done report:
- docs/ui_exec/99_DONE_REPORT.md including:
  - commands to run
  - routes implemented
  - queries implemented
  - test results
  - screenshot list

## Acceptance checks
- Tests pass.
- Screenshots exist for all main routes.
- Done report complete.

## Stop condition
Any failing test → STOP until green.
