# Step 7 — HIGH-FIDELITY VISUALS FROM RUNNABLE PROTOTYPE

## Objective
Generate visuals for approval from a runnable prototype using contract-shaped fixtures.

## Deliverables
1) Implement fixture mode (no backend wiring yet) with data shaped exactly like the contract.
2) Create prototype routes rendering:
   - Snapshot
   - Client Detail
   - Team Detail
   - Intersections
   - Fix Data
3) Export screenshots to docs/ui_spec/visuals/:
   - snapshot.png
   - client_detail.png
   - team_detail.png
   - intersections.png
   - fix_data.png

## Acceptance checks
- Visuals reflect the design system (editorial, sparse, proof-first).
- Proposal cards include: What changed, Impact, Hypotheses, Proof, Missing confirmations, Confidence.
- No “approve email” UI.

## Stop condition
Fixture shape deviates from contract → STOP and fix.
