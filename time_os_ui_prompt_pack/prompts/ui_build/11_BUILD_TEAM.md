# Step 11 — BUILD TEAM (Portfolio + Detail)

## Objective
Build Team views with responsible telemetry (no false precision).

## Deliverables
- /team portfolio
- /team/:id detail:
  - load vs throughput bands
  - responsiveness signals
  - issues/proposals scoped

## Acceptance checks
- No precise “hours worked” without explicit high confidence.
- Confidence + caveats visible.

## Stop condition
Surveillance vibe / fake precision → STOP and remove or reframe.
