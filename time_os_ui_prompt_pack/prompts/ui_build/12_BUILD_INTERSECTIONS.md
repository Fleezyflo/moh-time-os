# Step 12 — BUILD INTERSECTIONS (Couplings)

## Objective
Build Intersections workspace driven by couplings with evidence.

## Deliverables
- /intersections:
  - select Issue/Proposal
  - coupling map
  - why-drivers (signals + proof)
  - deterministic investigation path
- node/edge click opens drawer at correct evidence anchor

## Acceptance checks
- Coupling shows strength + why + confidence.
- No coupling without evidence.

## Stop condition
Couplings without “why” → STOP and fix.
